  questions:
  - content: "A SVM uses a hyperplane to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Separate data points into categories."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hyperplanes determine the category prediction for an example."
    - content: "Evenly distribute data of different classes across the feature space."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperplanes are used to best fit examples into categories."
    - content: "Shuttle data efficiently through memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperplanes are used to categorize examples."
    - content: "Predict another dimension."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperplanes don't predict dimensions."
  - content: "The margins play what role in SVMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define where the support vectors fall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Support vectors fall upon margins."
    - content: "Margins modify input data to ensure it's of the same kind."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Margins do not modify the input data."
    - content: "Ensure that the algorithm only reports two classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SVMs can predict as many classes as needed, if sufficient data is available."
    - content: "No role."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SVMs use margins for predictions."
