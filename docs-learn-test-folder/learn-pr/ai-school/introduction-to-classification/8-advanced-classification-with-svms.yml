  questions:
  - content: "A soft margin SVM gives a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Lower penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The soft margin SVMs have a lower penalty for datapoints that fall within the margin."
    - content: "Higher penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Soft margin SVMs have a low penalty for datapoints that fall within the margin."
    - content: "No penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Soft margin SVMs still give a penalty for datapoints that fall within the margin."
    - content: "Negative penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The penalty for datapoints that fall within the margin is positive."
  - content: "The Kernel trick allows:"
    choices:
    - content: "Kernels that are not straight lines, flat planes, or similar."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The kernel trick allows far more complicated categorization of examples."
    - content: "Unrelated operating systems to pass information freely between one another for improved training performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The kernel trick helps categorize examples."
    - content: "The soft-margin SVM to be mathematically possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The kernel trick allows for multiple different types of algorithms to perform pattern analysis."
    - content: "Predicting of only one category."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The kernel trick allows for predicting multiple categories."
